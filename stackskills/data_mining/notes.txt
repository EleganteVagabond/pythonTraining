Data analysis steps

1) get the data
2) look at the data
3) clean the data
-determine what to do with missing values
-determine what to do with outliers (visualize using sns.boxplot or [column name].hist)
--x2=x[ (condition one) & (condition two)] where condition is like X.bedrooms < 6
-check the data to make sure it comes in the right format (maybe it's just object and you want something else)
4) look at correlations and plots to see what is important (df.corr().loc['rows','columns'] (either can be :)

Groupby = df.groupby('any','cols','you','want').[some field].[statistic type]

Look at heatmap to see which values seem to be the most predictive  = sns.heatmap(df.corr())
